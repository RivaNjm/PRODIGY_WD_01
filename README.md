TIC TAC TOE- Project for Prodigy InfoTech Internship
🌟 Tic Tac Toe Game: From Scratch to Fab! 🌟
Hey everyone! I just wrapped up a super fun project: creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🎉
🔹 Here’s How It Went Down:
• Step 1: The Skeleton (HTML): Started by building the basic structure of the game. Think of it as laying down the bones.
• Step 2: The Makeover (CSS): Then, I gave it a stylish look with CSS – added some colors, fonts, and a neat layout to make it easy on the eyes.
• Step 3: Bringing It to Life (JavaScript): Finally, I breathed life into the game with JavaScript. I made it interactive, added the game logic, and even made it responsive so it looks great on any device!
🔹 What I Learned:
• HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Magic: Got a deeper understanding of how these technologies come together to create something fun and interactive.
• User Interface Design: Learned the art of making a clean and attractive interface.
• Game Logic: Figured out the logic behind Tic Tac Toe, including the 8 ways you can win. 🏆
• Responsiveness: Used JavaScript to ensure the game looks good and works well on different screen sizes.
It was like building a body, dressing it up, and then bringing it to life – such a cool experience! Can't wait to dive into the next project. 🚀
